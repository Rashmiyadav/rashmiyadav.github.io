And creating one is certainly through and challenging as you are creating a realistic 3D view out of a 2D painting.</p>

<p>3D graffiti, whether it’s in chalk or paint, on walls or the street, represents a new way of combining the mastery of Renaissance art techniques with the gritty, ephemeral qualities of amazing street art.
